# Script to fix OneView expired certificate msg: "Delete the expired certificate from OneView, regenerate a new certificate and add the new certificate to OneView with the same alias name."
#
# Useful to generate a new certificate in iLO4 v2.55 when the iLO certificate is expired
# In iLO 2.55, renaming the iLO name + reset does not generate a new certificate in iLO
#
# To learn more, refer to this CA:
# https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03743622
#
# This script is using 'RefreshFailed' status in Server Hardware to select the impacted servers and then it collects their iLO IP addresses
#
# Requires the HP iLO Cmdlets for Windows PowerShell (HPiLOCmdlets library), see https://www.hpe.com/us/en/product-catalog/detail/pip.5440657.html 
#
# When the script execution is complete, it is necessary to import in OneView the new iLO certificate using the iLO IP address (From Settings > Security > Manage Certificate page)
